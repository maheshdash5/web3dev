Hello World!

How Does Blockchain Work?
Blocks:
Data is stored in "blocks."
Each block contains:
A list of transactions.
A timestamp.
A cryptographic hash of the previous block.
Chain:
Blocks are linked together in a chronological order.
This creates a "chain" of blocks, hence the name "blockchain."

Important Terms
Nonce:
A unique number that miners must find to produce a valid hash.
Used only once, it ensures the resulting hash satisfies the blockchain's difficulty conditions.
Finding Nonce 
Miners and Compute Power
Miners produce blocks in the blockchain.
The probability of producing the next block and earning the reward increases with more compute power.
Compute power is needed to calculate the correct nonce.
Nonce and Proof of Work (PoW)
The nonce is a number that, when added to the block data and hashed, produces a hash meeting the network's difficulty criteria.
The process of finding this nonce is known as Proof of Work (PoW).
Consensus Mechanism
A method ensuring all participants agree on the blockchain's state and the validity of transactions.
Acts as a rulebook for validating transactions and blocks.
Proof of Work (PoW)
A consensus mechanism used in blockchain networks.
Requires solving complex mathematical problems to find the correct nonce.
Ensures the security and integrity of the blockchain by validating transactions and adding new blocks.
